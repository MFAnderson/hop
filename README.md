### <a name="dev_hop"></a>Developing hop
Make sure you have docker running.

Hop is written in python 3.5, and we recommend you use virtualenv to develop hop. After cloning this repository, cd into `hop` and run:

```bash
virtualenv -p python3.5 .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
make init
```

The current integration test suite runs against a local Docker provider. This means you need to have Docker installed and running.
To run the tests:
```bash
make develop
make unit # unit tests
make integration # integration tests
make test # pylint, unit and integration tests
```

Take a look at the `Makefile` to see what else is available.
